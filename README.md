# Hello, my name is Stephanie!👋🏼

Marketing professional turned software engineer with a passion for technological innovation and delivering exceptional service to clients. I draw upon my seven years of marketing experience to build efficient solutions to complex problems that positively impact the user experience.

My favorite part about software engineering is being able to embrace my creativity 🎨 and continuously learn by problem-solving 🧠.

When I’m not coding, I'm most likely:
<ul>
  <li>flowing at my local yoga studio 🧘🏻‍♀️</li>
  <li>immersing myself in an RPG 🎮</li>
  <li>hiking in Shenandoah National Park 🌲</li>
  <li>devouring a fantasy novel 📖</li>
</ul>
